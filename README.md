# Business Problem 
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximum bidding'.
One of our customers, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.

# Dataset Story
This data set, which contains the website information of bombabomba.com, includes information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, and the earnings information obtained from it. There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups. The maximum attachment strategy was presented to the control group, and the average attachment strategy to the test group.
